# JEPT
Nasa JPL EPHEMRIS PROCESSING TOOL


This is a tool for viewing azimuth and eleveation of selected spacecraft from JPL ephermis data based on entered QTH location.

The ephems are pulled live from Nasa JPL so it wont work without interntet connection for now.

Keep in mind that this code is still not done, needs a lot of changes and features but it somewhat works.
